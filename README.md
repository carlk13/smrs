# **Generating Sufficient Querysets for Information Pursuit using Sparse Representative Modeling**

This repository contains the implementation in python using pytorch of the Sparse Modeling Representative Selection algorithm proposed by Elhamifar et al. in "See all by looking at a Few " for the Bachelor's Thesis of **Carl Kemmerich**, supervised by Prof. Dr. Gitta Kutyniok and Stefan Kolek M.Sc. at the Bavarian AI Chair for Mathematical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t Munich.

## Getting Started

This project uses `uv` for dependency management.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/carlk13/smrs.git
    cd smrs
    ```
2.  **Prepare the environment:**
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

## Usage
### Running smrs on the cosine similarity matrix of a queryset and cifar10
Run the `main.py` file to select representative queries
```bash
uv run python main.py \
    path/to/your_query_file.txt \
    100 \
    10 \
    --alpha 10.0 \
    --r 0 \
    --max_iterations 200 \
    --delta 0.05 \
    --verbose \
    --run_without_pruning
```

### Running smrs on a standard dataset to test its effectiveness
Run the `run_smrs_on_dataset` script for example with the following command
```bash
uv run python run_smrs_on_dataset.py \
    --dataset cifar10 \
    --split test \
    --filter_class 8 \
    --alpha 10 \
    --r 0 \
    --max_iterations 200 \
    --verbose   
```

### Generating a Query Set 
Use this prompt to generate a queryset.
```
Information Pursuit (IP) is an explainable prediction algorithm that greedily selects a sequence of interpretable queries about the data in order of information gain, updating its posterior at each step based on observed query-answer pairs. The algorithm requires a queryset of task-relevant queries. For example if the class labels are
- car 
- horse 
- boat 
- bird
then a good queryset could contain queries such as
- four-legs 
- water 
- wheels 
- wings 
- metal body 
- living thing 
- animal 
- street 
- traffic light 
Note the queries should probe the presence of semantically meaningful things but never ask exactly for the class label, i.e. the query should not be a synonym of the class label car. Next I will give you the class labels and I ask you to output exactly 2000 queries. Please output them in a way so that I can immediately save them as a .txt, i.e. each query is in a new line and they are not enumerated.
